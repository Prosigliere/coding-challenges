# Coding Challenge - PHP - Fullstack Assessment

# The eCommmerce Product Managment

## Instructions

Create a Laravel application for showing and managing available products on a webstore. 

## Requirements

Language: PHP (Laravel Framework) 

Frontend: Use either the Blade environment or Vue. Styling is up to you, but keep it readable and usable. 

Database: Use any SQL database (MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQLite, etc)

Product Entity: A product in the ecommerce context should at least have name, picture, price, and a list of up to 10 attributes (e.g color, size, material, etc). 

## Views 

Product Show View:
	- Display all active products.
	- Show name, picture, price and Attributes.
	
Product Management view:
	- Allow adding new products. 
	- Allow deactivating and re-activating products. 
	- Deactivated productos should no longer appear in the Product Show view. 
	
Authentication and private / public handling of the views are not part of the assessment. It's something that would be built in the future.
