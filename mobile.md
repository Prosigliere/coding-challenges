## Time Constraint

Try to keep your development to around 4 hours.  We want to see your work, but we also donâ€™t want to take up a ton of your time.  Use judgement on what will help showcase your skills appropriately. 

If you run out of time, it is okay to not implement all of the requested features in the challenge
